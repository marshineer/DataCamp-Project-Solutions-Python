#A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners

##Project Description
A statistical analysis of Nobel Prize winners and the associated demographic trends. The first part of the notebook comes from the forked repo. There is a clearly marked point where my analysis begins. This project was undertaken to practice using git in a more systematic manner, as well as to gain practical experience in data analysis techniques. 

##Setup
Python version 3.9.7
The conda environment requirements for running the project are included in the yaml file. It includes only a Jupyter notebook and the associated data.
